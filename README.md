# AWS Document Data Extraction Platform

This is the source code for the Document Data Extraction Platform prototype. It is an extensible platform that performs intelligent document processing with AWS Textract. Users are able to extend the platform by creating generic schemas that define documents that they want to process. The schemas are used to coerce extracted values from documents into the correct types. After data extraction, users are able to live edit the extracted values via the web application. Once the document has been reviewed, metrics will be updated on the dashboard to give latency, accuracy and confidence metrics for each form.

Tech:

- Amazon Textract
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon S3
- AWS Step Functions
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- Amazon Cloudfront

## Solution Architecture

![Solution Design](/readme//solution.png)

The solution includes a front-end web interface implemented as a single page React web application, hosted on S3 and delivered via CloudFront (a content distribution network service) and a disclosure data extraction platform accessed via a collection of secured REST APIs. This platform provides:

- a serverless ML data extraction pipeline
- document & form processing/review state management
- storage of uploaded documents
- storage of forms extracted from those documents
- a registry of form description schemas
- storage of data extracted from those forms mapped to the form structure schema

## Solution Web Application

On the home page, you will see a dashboard that has metrics that give clarity about the platform's performance in general. For example, `Average Extraction Accuracy` reflects the average accuracy of all forms processed by the platform.

Central to the application is the schema registry where you can register schemas that you want textract data to map to. It also tracks a Average Accuracy metric which is the average accuracy of all forms that belong to this schema type.
![Schemas](/readme//document-schemas.png)

Once a document has been uploaded, it will automatically appear to be extracted in the `form` tab. There are tags which you can add and use as a filter in the search. Clicking the status will send you to the review page and set the form to be in "In Review" status.
![Forms](/readme//forms.png)

The review page shows a list of extracted fields where the **fields defined originate from the schema**, and the **values of a field are extracted from textract**. The right hand side is a pdf viewer. You can make edits to the individual fields, it will also draw a bounding box on where that field has been identified in the form. As part of the extraction metadata, you can tell which textract api was used to find the value of that field, whether it was query, form or table.

### Extraction, Review and Storage Backend:

1. An upload of a document in the frontend webapp stores it in s3 prior to processing and triggers the Document Processing Step Functions Workflow.
2. As part of the Classification Workflow, the document will be classified into a form by matching it to the selected schema type (selected from the UI) and its' metadata will be stored in DynamoDB.
3. Finally the Form Extraction Workflow\* will make an API call to Textract to extract data from the form. Fields from the selected schema type will be matched with Textract's results. If Textract's results identifies a key that contains results from Textract's QUERY, FORM and TABLE API, preference for selecting the value of the key will be given in the order of QUERY, FORM AND then TABLE. DynamoDB will be updated to store the correlated results between keys defined in the schema definition and Textract.

- Note: For the platform's extensibility, the Form Extraction Workflow can be invoked in parallel if the platform is extended to support extracting multiple forms within one document. Currently the platform is limited to one form per document and hence the Form Extraction workflow will only run once per document.

### Lifecycle of an uploaded file:

1. Uploaded files are recorded as a single instance of 'document'
2. After extraction state machine is run, it will be stored as a 'form'. There is a distinction between form and document as a document may contain multiple forms. However that is not supported by this platform at the moment. See more in the section `Limitations of the platform`

## Using the Platform

### Crafting schemas

**Before you begin uploading a document, you must craft a schema definition** that is a JSON representation of the data types expected to be extracted. The schemas will store in a schema registry that the platform maintains as a table in DynamoDB. First level of nesting in the json representation will be to identify the different parts that a form contains. These are essentially sections of a form.

The next level of nesting will be to identify the different fields that make up a particular section. For each field you must define the `order` in which it appears in the form from top to bottom as an integer, `title`, `type` being one of the following [array, boolean, integer, number, object, string] and an optional `extractionMetadata` object enriches the fields so that further information can be used when running textract. For example, the `textractQuery` property adds a query that Textract Query should run when trying to extract that field. `formKey` is used to help Textract Forms identify the title of the field. For fields found in a table, it is best to use the properties `tablePosition`, `rowPosition`, `columnPosition` when referring to tables in a form.

For more information refer to the spec.yaml's `FormJSONSchema`.

### Heuristics for Textract Query, Forms, and Tables

- Use query if the form contains a sentence structure with gaps in the text as user input to fill out.
- If Forms could not identify a particular field, it is recommended to add a query to the `extractionMetadata` of the field.
- For checkboxes found in forms, it is best to let Forms handle whether it is SELECTED or NOT SELECTED.
- For any table structures, enrich the schema's definition with the appropriate `extractionMetadata` to help identify which table, column and row a particular field is found.
- Confidence metrics for Forms are particularly low despite correctly determining the value and should be interpreted with caution.

### Limitations of the platform

- You can only extract a document once the appropriate schema has been added to the schema registry
- In the real world, documents can contain multiple forms but the platform is limited to only extracting one document per form. Each page included in the document must be relevant to the schema defined. Do not include an illustrative cover for example as no meaningful data can be extracted.
- There is no frontend component built to add tags on the webapp. However tags are supported in the backend.

### Adding workflow tags

- You can add tags to a form in review and default tags are defined in the REVIEW_WORKFLOW_TAGS const.

## Project Structure

This is a [PDK](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/) project, which uses [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen) to manage project files and dependencies. Infrastructure is
defined using the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

- `.projenrc.ts` - The entry point for projen, defining the high level projects and their dependencies in the monorepo.
- `packages/infra` - Contains the CDK infrastructure for the prototype.
- `packages/api` - Contains the [Type Safe API](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/developer_guides/type-safe-api/index.html), including an OpenAPI specification (`packages/api/model/src/main/openapi/main.yaml`), and API business logic (`packages/api/handlers/python`).
- `packages/lib` - Python project containing all lambda handlers for executing as Step Functions state machine steps, and other
- `packages/webapp` - The user interface written using [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- `node` version 18+
- `pnpm` (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- Python 3.9
  - Your `python` command must point to Python 3.9 prior to your first build. (Test with `python --version`)
  - You can use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage python versions, eg: `pyenv install 3.9.11 && pyenv global 3.9.11 && eval "$(pyenv init --path)"`)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [CDK version 2](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk#getting-started)
- Java 11+ (used by OpenAPI generator), (eg [Amazon Correto 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/what-is-corretto-17.html))
- poetry (`pip install poetry`)

### Getting Started

#### First Build

To build the prototype from scratch, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

This will install dependencies and build the repository.

#### Subsequent Builds

For subsequent builds, `pnpm build` is sufficient.

#### Deploy

Ensure you have an AWS profile set up with the region in which the application should be deployed,
and credentials for your target AWS account. This can be a named profile, or the default profile (omit the `--profile` argument).

```bash
aws configure [--profile <AWS_PROFILE>]
```

Next, bootstrap CDK (if you haven't done so already for your AWS account):

```bash
pnpm run bootstrap [--profile <AWS_PROFILE>]
```

And deploy:

```bash
pnpm run deploy [--profile <AWS_PROFILE>]
```

#### Webapp Local Dev Server

The webapp "points" to a particular backend based on its `runtime-config.json` file.

For local development, you will need to copy the generated `runtime-config.json` file into your `packages/webapp/public` directory. An example on how to do this is as follows:

```
curl https://dxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net/runtime-config.json > packages/webapp/public/runtime-config.json
```

Replace the url in the above command with the cloudfront URL of the UI for your deployment.


### Useful Commands

- `pnpm projen` - Regenerate the project configuration files from the `.projenrc` file.
- `pnpm build` - Build the project
- `pnpm run deploy [--profile <AWS_PROFILE>]` Deploy the application
- `pnpm run dev` - Run the local webapp dev server (prior to first run please read instructions above)

---

## FAQ

### Why are so many files read-only?

This project uses [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen) to manage project configuration files. They should not be manually edited, and instead are
synthesized by code in `.projenrc.ts`.
